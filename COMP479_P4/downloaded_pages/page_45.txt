Open data is data that is freely available in a convenient and modifiable form for anyone to use and redistribute as they wish without restrictions from copyright, patents or other restraints.         Technology has allowed Concordia to collect large amounts of data and information on a variety of topics, which the university feels should be accessible to all. Concordia’s open data makes machine-readable data easy to access from a single point and free to reuse without copyright, patents or other restrictions.  Want to request a new dataset?

Howard Webster Library Transformation Project technology program. As an opportunity for active and collaborative learning, the project scope was expanded to encompass the entire university.  Bringing together a cross-functional team with representatives from Instructional and Information Technology Services (IITS), Concordia Library and Enrolment Services, open data was created to provide a freely available, centralized catalogue of university-wide data.   The video footage at the top of this page is an example of the type of programs that can be created using open data. The open data team took one of the three.js library examples and added some logic to use the real-time library occupancy endpoint of our open data API as an input. The end result is a visualization where library patrons are represented as birds of a flock that’s constantly moving on the screen.         Frequently asked questions              Where do the datasets come from?          The datasets found within Concordia’s open data are collected from numerous contributing faculties, departments, units and sectors across the university. New information is constantly being added as it is provided. If you wish to contribute or request a dataset, please contact help@concordia.ca .             How are privacy guidelines respected?          Each dataset submitted undergoes a formal review process before going live on open data. Sensitive, personal and individualized information is stripped out prior to posting to ensure that all university confidentiality and privacy guidelines are respected.             How often is information updated?          Concordia’s open data consists of several different dataset categories: historical data, real-time data and general datasets. By its very nature, historical data will be updated less frequently than real-time data or general datasets. Each dataset is provided with an upload timestamp so users can easily identify when the information was updated.             Can I use the datasets freely?
