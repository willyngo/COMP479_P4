Normally, if no class cancellation notice is posted on the classroom door, classes are officially considered cancelled if an instructor is 15 minutes late for a 50‑minute class, 20 minutes late for a 75‑minute class, or 30 minutes late for longer classes. Consult the University’s academic regulations.                   Back to top    © Concordia University
